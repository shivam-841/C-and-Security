         - inet_pton() : Convert IP address from a text format to its binary representation.
         - inet_ntop() : Convert IP address from a binary form to its string format.
    -> Internet Address Structures
         - struct in_addr : Represent an IPv4 address in binary form
         - struct sockaddr_in : Defines an IPv4 socket address structure to hold both IP address and port number
         - struct sockaddr_in6 : similar to sockaddr_in but for IPv6 addresses
    -> Address Families
         - AF_INET : IPv4 address family
         - AF_INET6 : IPv6 address family
